          <p>Amsterdam's culinary scene is as rich and diverse as its culture, with traditional Dutch food being a highlight for locals and visitors alike. While the city offers a range of international dishes, traditional Amsterdam food is grounded in comfort and simplicity, reflecting the Dutch way of life.</p>

        <h1>Haring</h1>
        <p class="f1">Haring, or Dutch herring, is a beloved traditional delicacy in the Netherlands, enjoyed by locals and tourists alike. This raw fish, lightly cured in a salt brine, is typically eaten with chopped onions and pickles for added flavor. The Dutch have a unique way of eating it—holding the herring by its tail and taking a bite from the whole fish, though it can also be served in a sandwich, known as a broodje haring. Haring can be found at dedicated herring carts (haringhandels) and fish stalls throughout the Netherlands, especially in Amsterdam. It’s an authentic Dutch experience that gives visitors a taste of the country’s culinary tradition. </p>

        <h2>Stroopwafels</h2>
        <p class="f2">Stroopwafels are one of the most beloved Dutch treats, known for their crispy, chewy texture and rich caramel flavor. This iconic snack consists of two thin waffles pressed together with a layer of sweet, gooey caramel syrup (or stroop) in the middle. Traditionally, stroopwafels are enjoyed with a hot cup of coffee or tea—place the waffle on top of your cup for a minute to warm it up and melt the caramel, creating a deliciously warm, soft center.</p>
